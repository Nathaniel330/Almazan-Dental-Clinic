current work technique:

1. npm init, install

2. app.js
    require express, then make express()
    require dotenv, then make config
    require mongoose
    require routes*, .use the route(s)       *contains nothing for now


    view engine

    middleware

    connection
        port  .listen
        mongoose  .connect **    cant do this without step 3

3. .env ** 
    database link + credentials

4. model
    require mongoose

5.0 create controller
    require model

5.1 route
    require express
    require controller
    route*                                  *complete routing from app.js
        i.e. router.get(path, handler**)     **controller is the handler

***that is all. for me the most confusing part is the routing. it also does not help that
i know very little javascript and mongodb syntax, functions, methods. for now, i must understand the code - copy and pasting is fine. time will come i will be able to come up with my own functioning code.
